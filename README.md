### Technologies / Libraries / Programs
- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) provided the main structure of the page.
- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) allowed me to style elements of the website, and also customize Bootstrap styling.
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used throughout the project for its modern and responsive layouts. Navbar, forms, grid and accordion were the main components used.
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) is used with Bootstrap to provide the responsive navbar.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) provided several icons to help make the website look more attractive and give text more emphasis.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import two fonts into the project; Bebas Neue for headings and titles, and Barlow Semi Condensed for other text. 
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was used via the terminal for version control.
- [Github](https://github.com/) was used to host and store the project files.
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was my primary IDE during project development. The VSCode likeliness helped to provide a familiar working environment.
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create wireframes for the project.
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) is a palette tool which groups complimentary colours together and was used to select my main website colours.
- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) is a tool which allowed me to see and show pages of the website in different screen sizes.
- [CopyPaste CSS](https://copy-paste-css.com/) was used when picking an appropriate animation for button.

### Testing the code
Throughout the project, I used the W3C validator tools to find and fix various typos or errors in my code.
-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)

## Setup, Backups & Depoyment
[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was used as my primary IDE.
A template was provided by Code Institute which I cloned for my project repository.
Opening the repository in Gitpod is made simple thanks to a [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-always-ready-to-co/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki).
index.html and other files & folders were created via a combination of terminal commands and GUI shortcuts.

Git / Github were used for file versioning and hosting.
git add . was used initial to add my files and folders to the staging area, followed by git commit -m "Initial commit" and git push to finally add them to my Github repository.
Throughout the project, I was careful to use Git often and tried to make commits as descriptive as possible as well.

Once completed, I used Github pages to host the website.
This was done via the following steps;
- Go to the repository you wish to add to Github pages.
- Select the settings option
- Slect pages in the left column
- Select the master branch and /root folder
- Click Save
- The link will appear after the page refreshes and the website will now be live.
